  description: >
    This paper addresses the drawbacks of applying CNNs to spherical topologies such as those seen in medical imaging structures by 
    proposing a novel convolution filter analogous to the standard convolution on the image grid. A Spherical U-Net architecture is developed 
    which replaces all operations in the standard U-Net with their spherical operation counterparts.

 - title: "Black Magic in Deep Learning: How Human Skill Impacts Network Training"
   description: >
    This paper presents an initial study to assess how a user's prior experience with deep learning impact accuracy. 
    The results show a strong positive correlation between the participant's experience and the final performance. They additionally indicate that an experienced participant finds better solutions using fewer resources on average.

- title: "Knowing what you know in brain segmentation using Bayesian deep neural net"
   description: >
    In this paper, a Bayesian deep neural network (DNN) is proposed for predicting FreeSurfer segmentations of structural MRI volumes. 
    The network is trained using a novel spike-and-slab dropout-based variational inference approach and outperforms other methods in terms of similarity 
    between the segmentation predictions and freesurfer labels.

- title: "Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning"
   description: >
   An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. 
   During deployment, this can lead to issues such as instability and poor model behavior in practice. 
   This review paper shows the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.
